# Soul Searching Desktop

Originally an Android application, *Soul Searching* is now also available as a desktop application.
For now, it works for Linux. The best way to use the application is with a flatpak, as it holds all the needed dependencies for the app to work properly.

## Building the application
Use the `packageFlatpakReleaseDistributable` gradle task to build a flatpak of the application.
